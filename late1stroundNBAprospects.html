                    <a class="Jaden2-image-link" href="images/JadenHardy.jpeg" data-lightbox="NBAlate1stround" data-title="Jaden Hardy">
                        <img class="Jaden2-image" src="images/JadenHardy.jpeg" alt="Jaden Hardy" width="200"/></a>
                    <p>11: Jaden Hardy -- Coming into the year, Jaden Hardy was billed as a possible top-3 pick,
                    and while he still possesses immense potential, his time in the G-League has exposed some flaws 
                    in his game. Hardy is clearly a score-first player, but his tendency to shoot the ball so often 
                    has caused his efficiency to plummet, as he is currently shooting around 35% from the field and 
                    under 30% on 3-pointers. If Hardy is able to improve his decision-making, he still has the athleticism 
                    and ball skills to be an elite scoring guard in the NBA.</p></div>

                <div>
                    <a class="Jalen-image-link" href="images/JalenDuren.jpeg" data-lightbox="NBAlate1stround" data-title="Jalen Duren">
                        <img class="Jalen-image" src="images/JalenDuren.jpeg" alt="Jalen Duren" width="200"/></a>
                    <p>12: Jalen Duren -- Jalen Duren was initially expected to be a part of the 2023 draft class, but 
                        reclassified to join Memphis as a freshman this year and enter the 2022 draft class. As a result, 
                        Duren is one of the younger players in this draft class with a lot of upside, particularly on the 
                        defensive end. Despite being only 18 years old, Duren already has a chiseled 6’11”, 250 pound 
                        frame with a 7’5” wingspan, which he has used to block around 2.5 shots per game. If Duren develops 
                        a better shooting touch and expands his offensive skillset, he could emerge as one of the best big 
                        men in the NBA a few years down the road.</p></div>

                    <a class="Nikola-image-link" href="images/NikolaJovic.jpeg" data-lightbox="NBAlate1stround" data-title="Nikola Jovic">
                        <img class="Nikola-image" src="images/NikolaJovic.jpeg" alt="Nikola Jovic" width="200"/></a>
                    <p>13: Nikola Jovic -- The highest-ranked international prospect in these rankings, Nikola Jovic is a 
                        raw wing with high potential due to his rare skillset. While possessing 6’10” size, Jovic plays 
                        more like a guard, taking on a sizable amount of playmaking duties while playing overseas for 
                        Mega Mozzart. Jovic currently averages over 3 assists per game, while also shooting nearly 40 percent 
                        from the 3-point line. It may take a few years for Jovic to adjust to the NBA, but he has the 
                        potential to be a high-level offensive creator.</p></div>

                <div>
                    <a class="Kendall-image-link" href="images/KendallBrown.jpeg" data-lightbox="NBAlate1stround" data-title="Kendall Brown">
                        <img class="Kendall-image" src="images/KendallBrown.jpeg" alt="Kendall Brown" width="200"/></a>
                    <p>14: Kendall Brown -- Kendall Brown’s value is derived from his elite athletic ability and strong 
                        defensive potential. Brown is still a work in progress on offense, but he knows how to get open 
                        with sharp cuts to the basket, and has produced almost a 65% field goal percentage by only taking 
                        high-percentage shots. While Brown still has to work on becoming a bigger shooting threat, 
                        his 6’8” frame on the defensive end allows him to guard multiple positions and highlights the 
                        potential for Brown to be a top-level defender in the NBA.</p></div>

                <div>
                    <a class="Kennedy-image-link" href="images/KennedyChandler.jpeg" data-lightbox="NBAlate1stround" data-title="Kennedy Chandler">
                        <img class="Kennedy-image" src="images/KennedyChandler.jpeg" alt="Kennedy Chandler" width="200"/></a>
                    <p>15: Kennedy Chandler -- Kennedy Chandler is a small but dynamic point guard prospect. He is only 
                        6-feet tall and 171 pounds, but his combination of superb quickness, ball skills, and a high IQ 
                        allow him to find success against taller opponents. Chandler is currently averaging around 5 assists 
                        per game and over 2 steals per game, indicating that he is able to use his smarts to make the 
                        right play on offense and defense. His ability to make plays for teammates and force turnovers 
                        on defense will allow him to find success as an NBA point guard.</p></div>

                <div>
                    <a class="Dyson-image-link" href="images/DysonDaniels.jpeg" data-lightbox="NBAlate1stround" data-title="Dyson Daniels">
                        <img class="Dyson-image" src="images/DysonDaniels.jpeg" alt="Dyson Daniels" width="200"/></a>
                    <p>16: Dyson Daniels -- Dyson Daniels is current operating as a primary facilitator for the G-League Ignite 
                        team, demonstrating rare point-guard skills for a 6’6” player. Daniels is averaging over 4 assists 
                        per game, showing high-level passing skills against professional competition. Additionally, Daniels’ 
                        height advantage as a 6’6” guard allows him to be a defensive mismatch with his length, as he is 
                        averaging almost 2 steals per game. Daniels could work to improve his shooting touch, but already 
                        offers the potential to be an elite defender and primary facilitator in the NBA.</p></div>

                <div>
                    <a class="Jean-image-link" href="images/JeanMontero.jpeg" data-lightbox="NBAlate1stround" data-title="Jean Montero">
                        <img class="Jean-image" src="images/JeanMontero.jpeg" alt="Jean Montero" width="200"/></a>
                    <p>17: Jean Montero -- Jean Montero is a 6’2” point guard with elite ball skills that have allowed him 
                        to find success on every level to this point in his career. Despite not possessing elite athleticism, 
                        Montero uses effective changes of pace to separate from defenders. His already high skill-level 
                        should make it easier to Montero to adapt to the NBA game than other prospects, but his ability 
                        to minimize his defensive deficiencies due to his small frame will determine how effective Montero 
                        can be in the NBA.</p></div>

                <div>
                    <a class="Jeremy-image-link" href="images/JeremySochan.jpeg" data-lightbox="NBAlate1stround" data-title="Jeremy Sochan">
                        <img class="Jeremy-image" src="images/JeremySochan.jpeg" alt="Jeremy Sochan" width="200"/></a>
                    <p>18: Jeremy Sochan -- Jeremy Sochan is a 6’9” forward who has proved to be a versatile option for the 
                        Baylor Bears this year, helping them to a top-10 record by contributing at a variety of different 
                        positions. Sochan’s high IQ and good defensive instincts have allowed him to play anywhere from 
                        on the wing to serving as a small-ball center in certain scenarios. He already looks to be a valuable 
                        role player in the NBA, but becoming a bigger outside shooting threat would help him become a true 
                        all-around threat.</p></div>

                <div>
                    <a class="Ochai-image-link" href="images/OchaiAgbaji.jpeg" data-lightbox="NBAlate1stround" data-title="Ochai Agbaji">
                        <img class="Ochai-image" src="images/OchaiAgbaji.jpeg" alt="Ochai Agbaji" width="200"/></a>
                    <p>19: Ochai Agbaji -- Ochai Agbaji is the lone senior in these player rankings, but it seems that he made 
                        the right decision by waiting to enter the draft, as he is currently in the midst of a career year. 
                        During his first few years at Kansas, Agbaji developed a reputation as an athletic, defense-first 
                        wing, but this year Agbaji has emerged as a scorer, averaging over 20 points per game while shooting 
                        over 45 percent from 3. As a senior, he may not have as much upside as other prospects, but he offers 
                        solid role player potential as an athletic 3-D wing.</p></div>

                <div>
                    <a class="Wendell-image-link" href="images/WendellMooreJr.jpeg" data-lightbox="NBAlate1stround" data-title="Wendell Moore">
                        <img class="Wendell-image" src="images/WendellMooreJr.jpeg" alt="Wendell Moore" width="200"/></a>
                    <p>20: Wendell Moore -- Wendell Moore failed to meet high expectations at Duke as a five-star recruit his 
                    first two years, but he has taken a significant leap in his junior season to be considered a potential 
                    first-round prospect. He has raised his 3-point shooting percentage up to 40% compared to 21% his 
                    freshman year, and has also exhibited elite playmaking ability for a wing by averaging almost 5 assists 
                    per game. His on-ball prowess could allow him to function as a solid secondary ballhandler in an NBA offense.</p></div>
