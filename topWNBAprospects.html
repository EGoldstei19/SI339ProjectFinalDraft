                    <a class="Rhyne-image-link" href="images/RhyneHoward.jpeg" data-lightbox="topWNBAprospects" data-title="Rhyne Howard">
                        <img class="Rhyne-image" src="images/RhyneHoward.jpeg" alt="Rhyne Howard" width="200"/></a>
                    <p>1: Rhyne Howard -- The top-ranked player in my WNBA rankings, Rhyne Howard is expected to be a star 
                    when she steps onto a WNBA court. At 6’2”, Howard has elite size for a guard, which she uses to 
                    her advantage on both the offensive and defensive end. Howard has averaged at least 16 points 
                    per game all 4 years she has played at Kentucky, but her assists total has risen to a career-high 
                    4.1 per game this year, indicating the she can be an elite scorer and facilitator in the WNBA.</p></div>
                
                <div>
                    <a class="NaLyssa-image-link" href="images/NaLyssaSmith.jpeg" data-lightbox="topWNBAprospects" data-title="NaLyssa Smith">
                        <img class="NaLyssa-image" src="images/NaLyssaSmith.jpeg" alt="NaLyssa Smith" width="200"/></a>
                    <p>2: NaLyssa Smith -- NaLyssa Smith is a skilled forward who is able to use her 6’4” frame to score 
                    over the top of defenders, while also displaying rare quickness and agility for a player so tall, 
                    which allows her to evade double teams. Smith already has the skillset to be a star in the WNBA, 
                    but the key to becoming an unstoppable offensive force will be to develop her perimeter shooting ability.</p></div>

                    <a class="Naz-image-link" href="images/NazHillmon.jpeg" data-lightbox="topWNBAprospects" data-title="Naz Hillmon">
                        <img class="Naz-image" src="images/NazHillmon.jpeg" alt="Naz Hillmon" width="200"/></a>
                    <p>3: Naz Hillmon -- Standing 6’2”, Naz Hillmon has established herself as a dominant force in the post 
                        during her time with Michigan. Her 20 points per game average on almost 60 percent shooting has 
                        led Michigan to a top-5 ranking this season. An underrated aspect of her game is her passing 
                        ability from out of the post, as she averages over 2 assists a game, demonstrating that she can 
                        be a threat as both a scorer and a facilitator.</p></div>

                <div>
                    <a class="Ayoka-image-link" href="images/AyokaLee.jpeg" data-lightbox="topWNBAprospects" data-title="Ayoka Lee">
                        <img class="Ayoka-image" src="images/AyokaLee.jpeg" alt="Ayoka Lee" width="200"/></a>
                    <p>4: Ayoka Lee -- Ayoka Lee is currently one of the most dominant players in women’s college basketball, 
                        averaging around 25 points per game for the Kansas State Wildcats. At 6’6”, she is one of the players 
                        in the NCAAW, which helps her average over 3 blocks per game as a dominant defensive force. Lee 
                        technically has another year of eligibility, but her success at the college level proves that she is 
                        ready to join the WNBA ranks next year.</p></div>

                    <a class="Ashley-image-link" href="images/AshleyJoens.jpeg" data-lightbox="topWNBAprospects" data-title="Ashley Joens">
                        <img class="Ashley-image" src="images/AshleyJoens.jpeg" alt="Ashley Joens" width="200"/></a>
                    <p>5: Ashley Joens -- Ashley Joens has been a college basketball star since her sophomore year, as she has 
                        averaged more than 20 points over the past 3 years for the Iowa State Cyclones. While her overall 
                        field goal percentage is down to 38% this year, Joens 3-point percentage has risen to almost 37%, 
                        as she is becoming a threat to score from all areas of the court. Joens’ versatility combined with 
                        her 6’1” frame will allow her to be a seamless fit in the lineup of numerous WNBA teams.</p></div>
                
                <div>
                    <a class="Shakira-image-link" href="images/ShakiraAustin.jpeg" data-lightbox="topWNBAprospects" data-title="Shakira Austin">
                        <img class="Shakira-image" src="images/ShakiraAustin.jpeg" alt="Shakira Austin" width="200"/></a>
                    <p>6: Shakira Austin -- Shakira Austin has a rare skillset that sets her apart from her fellow WNBA draft 
                        prospects, as she has a very tall 6’5” frame, yet also has shooting range that extends to the 3-point 
                        line. Austin is already very dangerous in the paint because of her size, so the fact that opponents 
                        have to watch guard her all the way out to the arc makes her even more of an offensive weapon. To maximize 
                        her potential, Austin just needs to find a steady balance of opportunities on jump shots and in the paint, 
                        so she can improve on her below 45% field goal percentage.</p></div>
                
                <div>
                    <a class="Rae-image-link" href="images/RaeBurrell.jpeg" data-lightbox="topWNBAprospects" data-title="Rae Burrell">
                        <img class="Rae-image" src="images/RaeBurrell.jpeg" alt="Rae Burrell" width="200"/></a>
                    <p>7: Rae Burrell -- Rae Burrell has underperformed somewhat during her senior year at Tennessee so far, 
                        but during her junior year, Burrell showcased a skillset that would be very valuable in the WNBA. 
                        As a junior, Burrell averaged almost 17 points per game while shooting over 40% from behind the 3-point 
                        line. Burrell also has good size for a guard at 6’1”, which means defenders must be concerned about her 
                        bullying them in the paint as well as burning them from behind the arc.</p></div>

                <div>
                    <a class="Veronica-image-link" href="images/VeronicaBurton.jpeg" data-lightbox="topWNBAprospects" data-title="Veronica Burton">
                        <img class="Veronica-image" src="images/VeronicaBurton.jpeg" alt="Veronica Burton" width="200"/></a>
                    <p>8: Veronica Burton -- Veronica Burton has consistently been one of the elite defensive players in women’s 
                        college basketball, and her steady growth on the offensive end has allowed her to develop into one 
                        of the top two-way prospects in this draft class. Burton averages an absurd 4 steals per game on the 
                        defensive end, while leading the Northwestern offense with around 17 points per game and 6 assists 
                        per game. Burton will be able to consistently force turnovers for opposing WNBA offenses, and has 
                        the potential to become a high-level offensive creator as well.</p></div>
                
                <div>
                    <a class="Evina-image-link" href="images/EvinaWestbrook.jpeg" data-lightbox="topWNBAprospects" data-title="Evina Westbrook">
                        <img class="Evina-image" src="images/EvinaWestbrook.jpeg" alt="Evina Westbrook" width="200"/></a>
                    <p>9: Evina Westbrook -- University of Connecticut has long been known as the powerhouse of women’s college 
                        basketball, and Evina Westbrook is yet another talented Husky ready to head to the WNBA. Westbrook is a 
                        confident 6’0” guard who has stepped up in the absence of star Paige Bueckers for the Huskies. Her ability 
                        to finish through contact while also shooting 3-pointers at a respectable clip (career-high of 38% as a 
                        sophomore) will make her a valuable asset to any WNBA team.</p></div>
                
                <div>
                    <a class="Destanni-image-link" href="images/DestanniHenderson.jpeg" data-lightbox="topWNBAprospects" data-title="Destanni Henderson">
                        <img class="Destanni-image" src="images/DestanniHenderson.jpeg" alt="Destanni Henderson" width="200"/></a>
                    <p>10: Destanni Henderson -- Destanni Henderson is one of the shorter prospects for the 2022 WNBA Draft, 
                        but she makes up for her diminutive stature with elite passing and shooting ability. Playing as the 
                        lead ballhandler for the top-ranked South Carolina Gamecocks, Henderson has averaged over 4 assists 
                        per game while shooting around 40 percent on 3-pointers. She figures to be an effective orchestrator 
                        of a WNBA offense once she enters the league. </p></div>
