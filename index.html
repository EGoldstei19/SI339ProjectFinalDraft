				<p>My name is Ethan Goldstein. I am an avid sports fan, and one of the sports
				that I am particularly enthusiastic about is basketball. There are many 
				aspects of the game that I find entertaining -- the speed of the game, 
				the competitiveness of each game throughout the season, and the suspense of 
				every moment when the playoffs come around. However, one of my favorite parts of the 
				season is in fact the offseason — particularly when it comes time for the 
				entry-level draft. This is a time when each team will have an opportunity
				to select the next big stars of professional basketball, and I love to follow the 
				prospects closely to see which players look the most ready to be stars.</p>

				<p>On this website, I will be posting my personal rankings for both NBA and WNBA 2022 
				draft prospects, based on who I think has the best set of skills to become a star 
				in the professional leagues. All of the potential prospects come from a variety of 
				different backgrounds — many play college basketball, but some currently play in lower-level 
				professional leagues, or even may play internationally. I will also be using this 
				website to discuss the history of the draft in both leagues, and how it is currently 
				set-up, for any viewers who may not be familiar or interested to learn more. This 
				website is intended to serve as a hub for all NBA draft information, and I hope it 
				provides an interesting perspective into the basketball world for any viewers!</p>
