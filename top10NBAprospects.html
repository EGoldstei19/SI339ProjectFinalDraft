                    <a class="Jabari-image-link" href="images/JabariSmith.jpeg" data-lightbox="top10NBAprospects" data-title="Jabari Smith">
                        <img class="Jabari-image" src="images/JabariSmith.jpeg" alt="Jabari Smith" width="200"/></a>
                    <p>1: Jabari Smith -- Jabari Smith takes the top spot in my player rankings
                    in large part because of his elite combination of length and shooting ability. 
                    His long 6’10’’ frame with a wingspan of over 7 feet, plus his 40% 3-point percentage 
                    make him a nightmare for offenses to guard, highlight the potential for Smith to become an 
                    elite shot-maker at the NBA level.</p></div>
                
                <div>
                    <a class="Chet-image-link" href="images/ChetHolmgren.jpeg" data-lightbox="top10NBAprospects" data-title="Chet Holmgren">
                        <img class="Chet-image" src="images/ChetHolmgren.jpeg" alt="Chet Holmgren" width="200"/></a>
                    <p>2: Chet Holmgren -- Chet Holmgren has an especially unique skillset for an NBA draft prospect, 
                    possessing guard-like dribbling and shooting skills even though he is as tall as most centers at 7’0”. 
                    While weight is a concern for Holmgren, as he currently stands at 195 pounds, you will likely not find
                    another player in college basketball averaging 3 blocks, 2 assists, and shooting around 
                    45 percent from 3. The potential for him in the NBA is limitless.</p></div>

                <div>
                    <a class="Paolo-image-link" href="images/PaoloBanchero.jpeg" data-lightbox="top10NBAprospects" data-title="Paolo Banchero">
                        <img class="Paolo-image" src="images/PaoloBanchero.jpeg" alt="Paolo Banchero" width="200"/></a>
                    <p>3: Paolo Banchero -- Paolo Banchero is another big man who possesses elite offensive upside, 
                    similar to Jabari Smith. He has very capably taken on the featured scoring role for a top-10 Duke
                    team this year, and his ability to win in the post and off the dribble indicate he can find success
                    as a lead scoring option in the NBA. The only things keeping him behind Smith and Holmgren
                    at the moment are his average athleticism and struggling 3-point shot.</p></div>

                <div>
                    <a class="Jaden1-image-link" href="images/JadenIvey.jpeg" data-lightbox="top10NBAprospects" data-title="Jaden Ivey">
                        <img class="Jaden1-image" src="images/JadenIvey.jpeg" alt="Jaden Ivey" width="200"/></a>
                    <p>4: Jaden Ivey -- Jaden Ivey is in the midst of a breakout sophomore year for Purdue
                    in which he has vaulted himself to the top of draft boards. The 6’4” guard has always exhibited 
                    elite athleticism, but his significant improvement as a shooter (44% from 3) is what has helped him 
                    become an unstoppable offensive force at the college level. Ivey’s combination of scoring and 
                    playmaking ability give him the chance to become one of the premier guards in the NBA.</p></div>

                <div>
                    <a class="Johnny-image-link" href="images/JohnnyDavis.jpeg" data-lightbox="top10NBAprospects" data-title="Johnny Davis">
                        <img class="Johnny-image" src="images/JohnnyDavis.jpeg" alt="Johnny Davis" width="200"/></a>
                    <p>5: Johnny Davis -- Johnny Davis is undoubtedly the most improved player in college basketball, 
                    going from a 6th man role as a freshman for Wisconsin to becoming arguably the best player in the country 
                    and a possible top-5 pick. Davis has led the charge for the Badgers this season with his uncanny ability 
                    to make tough contested shots, while also demonstrating outstanding rebounding ability for a guard at 
                    almost 8 rebounds per game. Davis does not possess the same athleticism as Ivey, but also has the 
                    potential to be a high-end NBA shooting guard.</p></div>

                <div>
                    <a class="Bennedict-image-link" href="images/BennedictMathurin.jpeg" data-lightbox="top10NBAprospects" data-title="Bennedict Mathurin">
                        <img class="Bennedict-image" src="images/BennedictMathurin.jpeg" alt="Bennedict Mathurin" width="200"/></a>
                    <p>6: Bennedict Mathurin -- Bennedict Mathurin is yet another sophomore guard who has significantly 
                    improved his game in the past year. He has used his smooth left-handed shooting stroke, he has 
                    upped his scoring average from 11 points per game to over 17 points per game while leading Arizona 
                    to a top-10 ranking. He has been a consistently solid 3-point shooter during his 2 years with the 
                    Wildcats, shooting almost 40 percent from the 3-point line. Mathurin’s shooting ability and 
                    success as a primary offensive option in Arizona’s offense show he can be a strong initiator
                    of offense in the NBA.</p></div>

                <div>
                    <a class="AJ-image-link" href="images/AJGriffin.jpeg" data-lightbox="top10NBAprospects" data-title="AJ Griffin">
                        <img class="AJ-image" src="images/AJGriffin.jpeg" alt="AJ Griffin" width="200"/></a>
                    <p>7: AJ Griffin -- AJ Griffin has arguably the most potential in the entire draft, but he has only 
                    been able to show it in flashes while serving as the first man off the bench for the Duke Blue Devils. 
                    Griffin possesses elite athleticism, and in limited minutes he has been able to pair that 
                    athletic ability with a 50-percent mark from behind the 3-point line. Griffin also has a 
                    long 7-foot wingspan as a wing, which will allow him to be an elite defender. In the best 
                    case scenario, Griffin will emerge as one of the best two-way wings in the entire NBA.</p></div>

                <div>
                    <a class="Keegan-image-link" href="images/KeeganMurray.jpeg" data-lightbox="top10NBAprospects" data-title="Keegan Murray">
                        <img class="Keegan-image" src="images/KeeganMurray.jpeg" alt="Keegan Murray" width="200"/></a>
                    <p>8: Keegan Murray -- Keegan Murray is yet another Sophomore playing in the Big Ten who has seen his 
                    performance skyrocket from Freshman to Sophomore year. The forward for the Iowa Hawkeyes is one of 
                    the top scorers in the country, averaging 22.3 points per game on around 55% shooting. Additionally, 
                    Murray averages over 2 blocks a game and 1.5 steals per game, as his near 7-foot wingspan allows him 
                    to be an impact defender. Murray is old for a sophomore at 21, so he may not have as much upside 
                    as his peers, but he looks to be a high-level role player in the NBA.</p></div>

                    <a class="Patrick-image-link" href="images/PatrickBaldwinJr.jpeg" data-lightbox="top10NBAprospects" data-title="Patrick Baldwin Jr.">
                        <img class="Patrick-image" src="images/PatrickBaldwinJr.jpeg" alt="Patrick Baldwin Jr." width="200"/></a>
                    <p>9: Patrick Baldwin Jr. -- Patrick Baldwin Jr. is currently playing away from the spotlight at 
                    University of Milwaukee under the tutelage of his father, but Baldwin has one of the highest 
                    ceilings in this draft. In high school, Baldwin developed a reputation as a dangerous shooter 
                    and displayed high-level ball-handling skills which were all the more impressive when you 
                    account for his tall 6’9” frame. Playing on a low-level team at Milwaukee with minimal support 
                    talent has caused Baldwin Jr. to struggle this season, but if a team is willing to take a 
                    chance he could emerge as one of the elite offensive mismatches from this draft class.</p></div>

                <div>
                    <a class="TyTy-image-link" href="images/TyTyWashington.jpeg" data-lightbox="top10NBAprospects" data-title="TyTy Washington">
                        <img class="TyTy-image" src="images/TyTyWashington.jpeg" alt="TyTy Washington" width="200"/></a>
                    <p>10: TyTy Washington -- University of Kentucky Coach John Calipari seems to send at least one 
                    high-level guard to the NBA draft every year, and this year TyTy Washington is next in line. 
                    His smooth offensive game has allowed him to seamlessly fit into Kentucky’s offensive scheme, 
                    where he is averaging 13 points per game and shooting almost 40 percent from 3. Washington projects 
                    to be a solid scoring option when he enters the draft, with underrated playmaking ability that could 
                    help him emerge as a successful playmaker as well.</p></div>
